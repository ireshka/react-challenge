## ‚≠ê About The Project

![Main project page](docs/charts.png)

You look at Budget App that I have made during my Dare IT portfolio challege.


My main challenge was getting to know new libraries and creating a working application from scratch based on provided boilerplate. Our great mentors prepared tasks that helped us create new functionalities and supported us during our 12-week programming journey.

### My good moments
- I learned how to use completely new libraries
- I got along with chart library
- I know how frontend and backend work together in larger apps
- MUI is not as bad as I thought
- I learned how to decide which tasks are most important when the deadline is approaching
- Friendly support during development is essential

### Built With :coffee: and...

During the project, I had the opportunity to get to know many new libraries and improve my skills with using others.
The most important one are:

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [React Chartjs 2](https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/)
* [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
* [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
* [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)
* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
* [Notistack](https://iamhosseindhv.com/notistack)

##  Functionalities

As a user you can play with the app and:
- track your spendings and display your expenses and income in a table
- look at your budget and spendings on charts
- create a budget and track how much money you have left
- notifications show you if everything is ok during adding/removing elements to budget or ledger

## App future

So many ideas, so little time

- [ ] app deployment - let it shine online
- [ ] dark theme
- [ ] authentication (user will use app on different devices)
- [ ] rewrite with Typescript for future development
- [ ] add a persistent database
- [ ] multi-language support
    - [x] Polish
    - [ ] English
